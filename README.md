# splitbill fullstack app - Live link TBC

*FYI - this project is WIP. Functionality is there but styling needs to be finished*

A fullstack, single page CRUD app that allows you to work out who owes who after an activity (e.g. a group holiday or trip to the pub). 

Uses Node/Express for the API routes and endpoints, React for the front end and a MySQL relational database to store and query the Activities, Friends and Receipts. 


## Features:
- Create, read, update and delete Activities/Friends/Receipts (split across 3 database tables)
- API built with Node/Express
- MySQL database
- React Router, for clean navigation through the app
- Fully responsive design (WIP)
